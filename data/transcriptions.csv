1596," It's our life. The ups and the downs, the joy and the strife. Wouldn't change it for the world. It's the path I preferred and excelled in. Men, women, and children feel this feeling. Universal light and it's universal meaning. The truthful setting free. The thoughts so appealing to me. Like being one with the beat, we achieve a newfound high. Man, it's easy to see. We mastered the mic. What I write's just life. My spirit just walks in the sky. Paradise."
1597," I'ma cheat the game like the spoiled chef. Smack them into silence and put them in timeout. Cut the hatred. If you don't have something good to say, then don't say it. Just to be real with y'all, everybody's an equal. Anybody can get it. No favorites. Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Serving feet. Serving feet. That's what I'm talking about, man. Making that illegal cream cheese, man. I mean, he's an actual game. How we doing? Gotta get a verse for y'all with that triple beam. Y'all my cousins.

1599," Even when it's strength we try to harness, my mental state tarnished. The way we act on streets is all tarnished. Even when we meek, we still tarnished. All the words we speak is mad tarnished. The core of man tarnished. They say at best we train savage. Train a Thor, Kek, collect his souls, all ravish. Raise my weary fist to catch my breath above the gutter. Gave away our hope and dignity is not to smother. We still suffer. Tragedy at times results in stutter. Stability off kilter. Resist within oppression. The struggle is a weapon. Perhaps this is a blessing. Existence is the lesson."

Bitter heart, bitter heart shadows will help you try to hide. Bitter heart, my bitter heart is getting just a little fragile."
1608, So bleak And what is time and soul we have What is time and soul we have To make you believe in To save you from leaving it all Dream of them lights So much brighter Voices louder I hear them weep Naive prayers Lone and futile The pulse that's rising Is boiling underneath Me to the core
