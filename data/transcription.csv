1586,"Problem solving's your policy, never dive deeper. Weakass, cause I popped him right after I fucked up your speakers. Better call a hospital. I just seen him treble stab, rip rap, damn, it's a suicide. Nah, scratch that, it's a homicide. Vulture with a mohawk slamming at your palm and eye. I'm just rapping like a bird of prey axe.

1596,"It's our life. The ups and the downs, the joy and the strife. Wouldn't change it for the world. It's the path I preferred and excelled in. Men, women, and children feel this feeling. Universal light and it's universal meaning. The truthful setting free. The thoughts so appealing to me. Like being one with the beat, we achieve a newfound high. Man, it's easy to see. We mastered the mic. What I write's just life. My spirit just walks in the sky. Paradise."
1597,"I'ma cheat the game like the spoiled chef. Smack them into silence and put them in timeout. Cut the hatred. If you don't have something good to say, then don't say it. Just to be real with y'all, everybody's an equal. Anybody can get it. No favorites. Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Serving feet. Serving feet. That's what I'm talking about, man. Making that illegal cream cheese, man. I mean, he's an actual game. How we doing? Gotta get a verse for y'all with that triple beam. Y'all my cousins. This is for my cousins with the triple beam dream. On rainy days, count ways to get cream. Stacking bundles. Keep on your toes."
1598,again they stole our vocal chords and sold them to the devil we used to raise our fists now our leadership just settles eyes off the ghettos keep watching those space shuttles amidst of this madness this madman that went even when we vote the opposite it all reverts to reagan silly christian pagans still clutching mid-stated back to ancient babylon that might unravel dawn misconstrued worldviews used to assault the misinformed kings that move and act like pawns artists conforming plain minstrel could we stink treat our young as criminals truth festers under scabby lies we the permanent underclass don't act surprised
1599,"Even when it's strength we try to harness, my mental state tarnished. The way we act on streets is all tarnished. Even when we meek, we still tarnished. All the words we speak is mad tarnished. The core of man tarnished. They say at best we train savage. Train a Thor, Kek, collect his souls, all ravish. Raise my weary fist to catch my breath above the gutter. Gave away our hope and dignity is not to smother. We still suffer. Tragedy at times results in stutter. Stability off kilter. Resist within oppression. The struggle is a weapon. Perhaps this is a blessing. Existence is the lesson."
